								<h2 class="major">Work Experience</h2>
								<h3 class="major">CME Group</h3>
								<h4>Software Engineer</h4>
								<p>Starting in June 2018, I have been a full-time Software Engineer at CME Group under Risk Systems. My current role is under the Triumph Risk Engine which is a Java application that calculates margins. Additionally we supply information to the Risk Dashboard which is consumed by internal Risk Analysts.
								<h3 class="major">CME Group</h3>
								<h4>Software Engineering Intern</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cmegroup.jpg" alt="" style="padding: 4px;"/></span>
								<p>During the summer between my junior and senior year of college, I interned at Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group in Chicago, IL. While at CME I got to explore Blockchain technology and its applications to financial services. I was able to work alongside senior developers designing proof of concept projects and do inter-department data aggregation.</p>
								<p>This was an awesome experience for me because I had exposure to so many new types of technology. Including Blockchain application development, new programming languages, and contributing to the business side of CME. We aimed to design something that would be a single source of information to feed smart contracts on a Blockchain.
								</p>
								<h3 class="major">PolySync</h3>
								<h4>Software Engineering Intern - TechLabs</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/polysync.jpg" alt=""/></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/polysync2.jpg" alt=""/></span>
								<p>PolySync is a start-up in the autonomous vehicle space focused creating a middle-ware that tunes sensors and actuators (including LiDAR, Radar, and GPS) to the vehicles physical controls (such as steering, brake, and throttle). They are a part of the mobility start-up incubator, TechLab, in the Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Michigan.
								</p>
								<p>My first two semesters with PolySync I worked with their lead software engineer and three other dedicated University of Michigan students. We developed a way-point following algorithm for the Lincoln MKZ equipped with sensors, actuators, and PolySync's software. During this time, we also isolated a configuration bottleneck in PolySync's software that slowed down development for their clients. This semester I am working with a new team of interns to integrate this management system into PolySync's current application.

								<h3 class="major">CS KickStart</h3>
								<h4>Co-founder, Program Director</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/2016cohort.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>During the last two years of college, I worked with four other incredible women to improve the enrollment and persistence of women in UofM’s computer science department. To do this, we designed a week long introduction to CS for incoming freshmen women, <a href="http://cskickstart.eecs.umich.edu">CSKickStart</a>. Our motivation stemmed from our own experiences, and data we gathered from a survey of the second programming class at UofM.
								</p>
								<p>We analyzed survey data from the second introductory programming class, EECS 280. We found that:
								<ul>
									<li>Women were less likely to have programming experience from before college.</li>
									<li>Women were less likely to picture themselves in a career with CS.</li>
									<li>Women found the atmosphere at UofM more competitive and unfriendly than their male counterparts.</li> 
								</ul>
								In creating the camp, some of the most difficult obstacles came from our peers. Professors, and students alike would tell us that the stigma isn’t real, and CS KickStart wouldn’t make a difference. Despite this, we persisted. I am extremely proud of the outcome of the camp. We received positive feedback from every single one of our participants, many of whom have decided to further their career in technology. We gave the participants a community, confidence, and inspiration. It is extremely rewarding to have seen all our hard work come together and have such a positive experience on the cohort. I hope to continue and expand CS KickStart, and erase the negative stereotype of women in technology.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Computing CARES</h3>
								<h4>Instructional Aide</h4>
								<p>Computing CARES is a Third Century Initiative at the University of Michigan aimed at improving the retention of women in computing. I recently became apart of this program in August of 2017. My role is to plan interventions in the intro computing classes. Some examples of this include explicitly addressing imposter syndrome, and implicit bias.</p>
								<p>Additionally we plan extracurricular activities where students can feel comfortable asking questions and receiving help outside the classroom. This coming month we are planning a "Mythbusters" panel with the objective of dispelling rumors within the Computer Science Department.
								</p>
								<h3 class="major">GEECS</h3>
								<h4>Outreach Committee, Mentor</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mentorship.jpeg"/></span>
								<p>GEECS stands for "Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science". It is a student organization within the University of Michigan created for the support and success of women in technology. I joined in 2015 after declaring my major and have been involved in the Outreach Committee ever since.</p>
								<p>The Outreach Committee is in charge of hosting events for elementary and middle school girls interested in technology. We hold three events per semester and teach them skills such as coding and using Arduinos. It is rewarding to see the students find confidence and inspiration from learning to code.
								</p> 
								<p>During my Junior year I became a mentor for underclassmen involved in GEECS. We meet twice a month during the Fall and Winter semester. During these events the mentees are able to ask questions about CS, Michigan, and life in general in an informal setting. Being a mentor to the underclassmen is very rewarding as I get to see them grow as students and women within the CS department.
